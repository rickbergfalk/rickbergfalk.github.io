      <title>What I Learned Building Ready Set SQL</title>

      <description>Ready Set SQL is a side project I started in the Fall of 2011. At the time I was teaching myself as I went, and also using it as a platform for learning all the fancy HTML/JS/CSS technologies I had been reading about but never actually done anything with.
It&amp;rsquo;s now Summer 2014, and Ready Set SQL is mostly finished. Or at least it&amp;rsquo;s as finished as it&amp;rsquo;ll ever be.</description>

      <description>What is it about the Business Intelligence that drives people (including myself) to find a universal one-size-fits-all solution? Is it because we&amp;rsquo;re tired of handling the endless onslaught of business requests? Is it because report writing eventually becomes extremely tedious? Is it because we start to feel we have a better understanding of business reporting requirements than the ones that write up the requirements?
Several months ago I decided to jump in and build that thing that&amp;rsquo;s been nagging my brain for several years.</description>

“Big Data” is for

- Asking the same question frequently across large volume of data
- Asking unique questions very infrequently across large volume of data
	- Performing “analytics”
		- How likely is it that a person that buys soap also purchases toothpaste, by each month since forever.
	- Statistics stuff
	- True data mining/predictive analysis

It is not for  

- Ad-hoc querying   
	- Show me all the people that bought soap in the last week, that also bought toothpaste  
	- Get me all the employees in the sales department

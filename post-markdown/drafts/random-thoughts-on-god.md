The world of when religion was started was an interesting. Consider what mankind knew of the world during the days of the Bible...

- Europe, Asia, and Africa were the only lands known.
- The world may have been flat
- The Sun revolved around the earth
- The starts were just dots of light up in the ether. 

Now we know about galaxies. It really is mind-boggling as to just how large the universe actually is. And that's the stuff we know about. Who's to say that in another 2000 years we'll discover some larger grouping of universes. 

Religion doesn't necessarily exclude the possibility of other beings out there, but it does sort of center around humanity on Earth. But even that's a little generous, because it really even goes further than that. Humanity on Earth, for a specific tribe of people.

The Jewish people were *God's chosen people* after all. The poor Indians, Asians, and Africans. God didn't choose them for some reason. Their god wasn't actually god at all, but rather some sort of manifestation of the devil. 

This kind of attitude isn't just applicable to Jewish people though. Christians have it too. In fact, even Christians argue with other Christians about how *their* interpretation of the Bible is right.  



TODO: If a personal relationship with God is stressed, does that make God different for each person? For example, my experience and relationship with God is one way, but someone else has a different relationship and experience with God. 

What if these experiences conflict? What if some of these experiences cause us to understand scripture differently? 

I'm pretty sure it has at some point (see all the different kinds of protestant denominations).

      <p>SQLPad 3 has gotten bloated and I'm gonna fight it.</p>
<p>The SQLPad build for upcoming version 3 rework has hit 2.68 MB.</p>
<p><img src="./bundle-20190422.png" alt="The initial bundle"></p>
<p>That's minified but uncompressed. Once gzipped Create-React-App says it'll squish down to 723.48 KB, which sounds better but doesn't change the fact it is still 2.68 MB of JS that needs to parse, compile, and execute. <s>SQLPad as become one of <em>those</em> JavaScript apps the Chrome dev relations team tweets and blogs about.</s> (Update 5/17: Actually never mind one of them tweeted that starting with create-react-app is a failure from the start so this whole effort is bogus probably)</p>
<p>I suppose one could argue that bundle size is not <em>that</em> important for an app like SQLPad. The target device is not mobile, and the experience is more of an application where you write SQL and analyze data, not a site where you consume content.</p>
<p>Still, there is opportunity to shave off some larger-than-necessary libraries and be a bit smarter and managing the bundle budget.</p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>Looking at the above bundle analysis a few things quickly became apparent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding Antd brought the size up real quick. (antd, icons, and related rc-components account for at least 750 KB of the bundle)</li>
<li>react-virtualized should be swapped out with react-window</li>
<li>Moment is fairly large and is overkill for what I am using it for (currently just date formatting)</li>
<li>SQL formatting doesn't need to happen in the browser - that could become an API call</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>The core SQLPad experience is centered around 2 JavaScript libraries</p>
<ul>
<li>Ace editor (422 KB + 25 KB for its React wrapper)</li>
<li>Taucharts (379 KB + 170 KB for its d3 dependencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>Because this is a React project, there's also react and react-dom adding another 112 KB.</p>
<p>This puts the core SQLPad project without my code or any of the smaller libraries or component libraries at about 1100 KB.</p>
<p>Before officially publishing SQLPad v3, I'd like to get the bundle size under 1.5 MB uncompressed at a minimum with 1.25 MB as a stretch goal.</p>

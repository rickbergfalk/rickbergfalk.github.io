This is subjective sure, but of the various React component libraries out there, I personally like the look of antd the most. It has a nice balance of having a modern clean look without being too flat. It has a nice density about it. The component APIs felt right and it was a pleasure using the components.</p>\n<p>And there are so many components. All the usual components are there like buttons and inputs, but then there are <a href=\"https://ant.design/components/cascader/\">cascading selections</a> and <a href=\"https://ant.design/components/steps/\">steps</a> and <a href=\"https://ant.design/components/auto-complete/\">AutoCompletes</a> and <a href=\"https://ant.design/components/mention/\">mentions</a> and <a href=\"https://ant.design/components/select/\">selects with tag modes</a> and <a href=\"https://ant.design/components/calendar/\">a calendar</a> and <a href=\"https://ant.design/components/tree/\">trees</a> and <a href=\"https://ant.design/components/timeline/\">timelines</a> and <a href=\"https://ant.design/components/drawer/\">drawers</a> and my favorite <a href=\"https://ant.design/components/modal/\">modals that animate open from the click location</a>.</p>\n<p>If you need a component, antd probably already has it.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately all that comes with a cost of a larger JavaScript bundle.</p>\n<p>When I set out to update SQLPad’s UI, I initially decided on antd because I wanted a library that had everything. I wanted the design to be cohesive, and I wanted it to be easy for others to expand on the UI if necessary. Instead of dealing with a random assortment of components I built, someone could simply take from the component library of antd.</p>\n<p>I think that’s a great benefit for a project, but I’m not sure if it is worth the cost for SQLPad.</p>\n<p>I ended up building my own tree and table components. The other big component experiences are a code editor and a charting library (also not antd).</p>\n<p>I should have maybe thought about this a bit more before I adopting a component library, but my component needs are pretty basic. Buttons, inputs, modals, toasts, and some tabs… I’m set. I don’t need a lot of the components listed above. For the more complicated components I do need, I can expand on some primitive react UI libraries like <a href=\"https://ui.reach.tech/\">Reach UI</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift\">downshift</a></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">              bundle  ~2.58 MB\n-               antd  ~?.??

			Bookmark Hoarding

			<p><em>Why am I collecting so many bookmarks?</em></p>
<p>Every once in a while, I try to clean up some of my bookmarks within Chrome. It’s become a necessity really. I’ve bookmarked so much stuff that I don’t even know what I have saved anymore. Even my organization has gotten out of hand. Multiple “read later” folders. Some “Misc” folders.</p>
<p>Part way through cleaning my Web Development bookmarks, I rediscovered a tutorial on how to hide/show comments like Digg did, from 2007. Here were my reactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holy crap. 2007!?</li>
<li>I remember this being when I was first getting into web development, which means I’ve been kinda sorta doing web development (as a hobby) for a little over 5 years now, and …</li>
<li>I have very little to show from all these bookmarks. I’ve spent waaay too much time reading and hoarding information. Years! and I have nothing to show for it. Sure I have some knowledge about web development, but what have I actually used it for?</li>
<li>This particular link doesn’t even work anymore, and it wasn’t alone I don’t think I even revisited it after a few days of discovering it. Why did I bookmark it?
What use are these bookmarks if the pages have since disappeared?</li>
<li>Why would I, in 2012, want to use a web technique from 2007 anyways?</li>
<li>I’ve become a slave to my bookmarks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why am I hoarding bookmarks?</h2>
<h3>I thought I needed them.</h3>
<p>I have big dreams of building things on the web. When I saw something cool, I bookmarked it just in case I might need it later. Whether it be a list of 50 Spectacular Minimalistic Blog Designs, 40 Web-app Backgrounds, or 7 videos every web designer must watch.</p>
<h3>Time Travel?</h3>
<p>I can’t let some things go, and I’m a sucker for nostalgia. For whatever reason, I like re-experiencing the past as much as I can. It’s my own form of time travel.</p>
<h3>Saving if for “later.”</h3>
<p>There is a lot of stuff on the internet, and a lot of ways to access it. Sometimes those cool links were discovered at an inconvenient time, and then saved for later use. Sometimes later never happened, and they just sat there collecting dust.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.readysetsql.com/">Ready Set SQL</a> is a side project I started in the Fall of 2011. At the time I was teaching myself as I went, and also using it as a platform for learning all the fancy HTML/JS/CSS technologies I had been reading about but never actually done anything with.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s now Summer 2014, and Ready Set SQL is mostly finished. Or at least it&rsquo;s as finished as it&rsquo;ll ever be. Here are my own thoughts on how things went and what I&rsquo;d do differently if I restarted the project for a fourth time.</p>

<h2 id="regarding-frameworks-and-libraries">Regarding frameworks and libraries</h2>

<p>When I started this side project, I sought out a bunch of libraries and frameworks to use. At the time I had been reading a lot about various web trends, so I used Ready Set SQL as a platform to experiment with a lot of things. I started with a traditional Express.js app, with a mix of server-side rendering with jQuery/javascript running the interactive front end stuff.
Then I got the bug to make it a purely client-side app, and tried a little Knockout. And then Backbone.</p>

<p>Shortly after doing that, I read posts about people migrating away from client-side web apps for various reasons. I could relate to some of them and realized it wasn&rsquo;t a good fit for what I was building, so began rewriting things again.</p>

<p>The next round was a combo static-html thing with some server side stuff. It was cool but the work flow got kind of clunky. Especially since I decided to split the repos (one for the static html content and generators, the other for the web-service and database).</p>

<p>In the end I went back to what I knew and what I had started with: a traditional Express.js app with jQuery and my own javascript objects.</p>

<h2 id="i-should-have-finished-the-first-iteration-before-starting-the-second">I should have finished the first iteration before starting the second</h2>

<p>One of the reasons it took so long to get Ready Set SQL to where it is now was because of the time I spent reworking things. In total, I probably rewrote the application 4 times.</p>

<p>In hindsight I wish I would have completed the first iteration before starting the second. Each time I reworked the first half of the project, I delayed learning about the challenges that would appear during the second half.</p>

<h2 id="i-should-have-written-the-lessons-before-i-wrote-the-tool">I should have written the lessons before I wrote the tool</h2>

<p>In all the lessons I&rsquo;ve written in the lesson editor I built, I&rsquo;ve only used about half the features. Little did I know that I would stick to a certain format for the lessons, and not actually need half the stuff I was building.</p>

<p>Basically, <em>You Ain&rsquo;t Gonna Need It</em>. Figure out what you need first. Then build it. And only build what you need.</p>

<p>Another saying that applies is <em>form follows function</em>. It was challenging to build a tool to build lessons when I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what the lessons would be like in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="the-lesson-viewer-might-not-have-been-the-best-approach">The lesson viewer might not have been the best approach</h2>

<p>Writing the lessons, I discovered I wanted to be more visual with certain things. I wanted to have SQL queries out on the page, with hand written notes pointing things out. Maybe a .gif of how a join works. Maybe more narrative, who knows.</p>

<p>What I know now though is that the lesson viewer setup demands lessons be a certain kind of way. Otherwise it feels awkward. The lesson viewer is set up in a way that expects the user to always be writing SQL. This works I guess if they were always going to write SQL, but sometimes I wish I had a better way to show and tell what the lesson is trying to teach.</p>

<p>The lesson content pane was also too small. It wasn&rsquo;t quite enough space for what I wanted to do with it. A full-width page, where you scroll down and came across visualizations, pictures, and an interactive editor might have been a better approach.</p>

<h2 id="i-enjoy-building-the-system-more-than-creating-the-lessons">I enjoy building the system more than creating the lessons</h2>

<p>This was a big realization. When the application side of things was mostly finished, I wanted to move on. All I had to do is create the lessons, but I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to do it. I kept procrastinating and putting it off.</p>

<p>I realized through this process that teaching is hard. It gave me a new kind of respect towards teachers, as well as other developers who write to teach what they know.</p>

<p>I also realized that teaching was something I didn&rsquo;t want to do without an audience. I built this tool knowing it&rsquo;d be valuable to some people, but I don&rsquo;t know any of those people. Not having a direct audience for feedback kind of killed any motivation I had to continue working on it.</p>

<h2 id="i-work-on-side-projects-in-seasons">I work on side projects in seasons</h2>

<p>Fall 2011 to Spring 2014 is a long time. In an age of people cranking out simple web-apps in a month or weekend, why did it take me 2.5 years!?</p>

<p>In some ways looking at the time I spent on this project is depressing. However, looking at the activity over the course of 4 rewites and 2 git repos, I realized that I work on my side-projects in seasons. I&rsquo;ll have spans of a few days to a few weeks where I work on my projects a bunch, only to abruptly stop and not touch them for months.</p>

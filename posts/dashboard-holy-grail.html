			<p>What is it about the Business Intelligence that drives people (including myself) to find a universal one-size-fits-all solution? Is it because we&#39;re tired of handling the endless onslaught of business requests? Is it because report writing eventually becomes extremely tedious? Is it because we start to feel we have a better understanding of business reporting requirements than the ones that write up the requirements?</p>
<p>Several months ago I decided to jump in and build that thing that&#39;s been nagging my brain for several years. It was a dashboard/database/web-app for reporting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in a nice way. The design in my head was simple. It was responsive. Flexible.</p>
<p>I doodled little diagrams. Mocked out the data structures. Started building things in Node.js. Things eventually got serious, and I whipped up a very limited prototype. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I played around with the result I started to ponder the usefulness of this tool.</p>
<p>Since all the KPIs were displayed in the same format, I began to find myself distracted by the labels and numbers, looking at the collection of sparklines. In a way the graphics were doing what they were supposed to be doing, giving me quick little insights to the trend of data. But the information I was looking at as a whole didn&#39;t seem very useful. </p>
<p>The results felt empty. I saw the numbers and their trends on the screen, but it <em>conveyed no meaning to me.</em></p>
<p>And I don&#39;t know if that is a fault of the tool or me not having a use for the tool. The data I loaded up wasn&#39;t 100% KPI related - some of it was more operational data, which really doesn&#39;t fit well with a KPI reporting format. </p>
<p>I can&#39;t get the idea out of my head. I can build a prototype but I ultimately have no use for it. I have no way of validating this concept.    </p>

			Difficulties with a real-time Data Warehouse
		</h1>
		<small>
			May 2013

		<div>
			<p>When building a Data Warehouse, at some point you must discuss how often the data must be refreshed. When you ask the business this question, they&#39;ll usually say something along the lines of, &quot;How often? We want it real-time!&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s been a lot of discussion in the Business Intelligence industry about &quot;real-time&quot; data warehousing. For a while it was all the rage, but it has since been quietly dismissed. BI people have even invented a new term like they always do - your data warehouse doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;real-time&quot;... it needs to be &quot;right-time.&quot;</p>
<h2>It will get complicated. fast.</h2>
<p>Real-time data warehousing is a lot more challenging to build and maintain than one that is bulk loaded. It&#39;s fragile. There are more moving parts that could break to keep it running. If something does break, then you have to make sure you properly load the missing data. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a lot more complicated. Running a real-time data warehouse usually involves shipping database log files, or setting up some form of change-data-capture. And to do that you can no longer use simple SQL scripts and stored procedure - you&#39;ll need to start utilizing specialized tools.</p>
<p>Compare this to the opposite - a bulk-loaded data warehouse that is fully rebuilt every month, week, or day. Bulk-loading databases and allowing them to fully be rebuilt is easy, cheap, and contains very little risk. Something goes wrong with today&#39;s data warehouse rebuild? Just load up yesterday&#39;s snapshot in a pinch.</p>
<h2>Today doesn&#39;t matter when looking at the last 5 years</h2>
<p>One of the main reasons to build a data warehouse is to create an environment where you have access to large amounts of data. You can run queries that analyze <em>years</em> of data, and they will finish in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>Think about this for a moment - If you are analyzing data from the last several years, what difference does it make if you have today&#39;s data or not? </p>
<p>Chances are it won&#39;t make a difference. If it doesn&#39;t matter if you run a report this morning vs. this afternoon vs. tomorrow then it doesn&#39;t matter if you have a real-time data warehouse. </p>

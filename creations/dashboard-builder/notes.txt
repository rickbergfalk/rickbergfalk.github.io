DASH APPLICATION FLOW

jqueryUI dialog is instantiated

------

icon is dropped


dummy obj is created, 
derivable properties filled in.


dash.BuildWidget(dummy object) is called,
creates new widget object


newWidget.openDialog() is called,
updates form according to newWidget object,
(not necessary going forward)
then opens the form


form button "Build Chart" is pressed,
get's newWidget's ID from form,
refrences that object,
calls updateWidget()
closes dialog restores control to user...






NEW FLOW (GOAL)

icon is dropped


dummy obj is created,
derivable properties filled in


dash.BuildWidget(dummy obj) is called,
creates new widget object


newWidget.openDialog() is called


if form has not been built, build form.
	build form: 
	loops through formSetup
	load setting values stored in object (may or maynot be defaults)
	open form


form button "build chart" is pressed.
function assigned will be done so within the object :) 



design a success, at expense of a form for each object.
